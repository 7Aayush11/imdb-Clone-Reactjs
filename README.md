# IMDB CLONE APP
This app is created using reactjs and Omdb api to fetch data. The interface is quite simple. First comes the home page where we get a similar feature like most movies/series streaming apps to swipe for some recommendations As the API doesn't provide with much options to fetch we had to make the feature using a static list. Then comes the second feature thatnis searching as the API provides us with vast result on searching we get to see all the available movies/series/game from the searched title. Also it provides with filter of searching based on type(movie/series/episode).

# Future work
In future we could add a actual recommendation system that works on AI and with some more home page carousel.
